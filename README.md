# 🌍 World Happiness Analysis (2015–2019)

## 📌 Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to **analyze global happiness trends** based on multiple social and economic parameters.  
Instead of relying on the direct "Happiness Score" column, a **Weighted Score** is computed by combining important factors with assigned weights:  

- GDP per capita (0.30)  
- Social support (0.25)  
- Healthy life expectancy (0.20)  
- Freedom to make life choices (0.15)  
- Perceptions of corruption (0.05)  
- Generosity (0.05)  

This approach gives a more balanced and fair estimate of happiness across countries and years.
